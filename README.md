# MoveTheDots
Day 2 of  of challenge to build 30 vanilla JS projects over 30 days (drag and drop game with polka dots)

A vanilla JS project with three primary files (index.html, index.js and style.css), as well as an image file
for the draggable dot.

Design
Basic styling to centre the dots and header and to fill the background without distracting from the dynamic CSS animations 
and drag and drop functionality itself.

Inspired by the polka-dot themed artwork of the Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama.
